                <h3>Data Analysis with Python</h3>
 <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential process for gaining
 insights into supermarket sales data. Through EDA, we can uncover patterns and
 decision-making in the retail sector.
 Conducting EDA on supermarket sales
data is not just a one-time activity but an ongoing process. Regular
analysis ensures that the business adapts to changing market
conditions and continuously improves its operations. Leveraging
EDA allows supermarkets to stay competitive, meet customer
demands effectively, and drive growth and profitability.</p>
